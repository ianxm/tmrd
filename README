tmrd - a simple sound delayer

OVERVIEW

tmrd takes sound card input (from mic or line in), delays it, and
passes it to a sound card output (speakers or line out).  tmrd stands
for "Tim's Merrill Reese Delayer."  It was written so Tim could delay
Merrill Reese's radio play by play to synchronize it with the Eagle's
broadcast on tv.  tmrd could theoretically be used to delay other
audio streams, but to my knowledge it's never been tried.

INSTALLATION

tmrd uses the Jack Audio Connection Kit (http://jackit.sf.net).

The following packages are required to compile tmrd:
- libjack-dev
- libncurses5-dev

The following packages are required to run tmrd:
- jackd

jackd must be running before tmrd can be started.  If you use alsa,
you can start jackd with:
> jackd -d alsa

Then start tmrd with:
> tmrd

INSTRUCTIONS

When tmrd opens it immediately starts delaying the input stream.  The
console displays the current delay in seconds, and the available
commands.  The up and down arrow keys change the delay time.  The 'q'
key closes tmrd.

tmrd will read from the default input stream (line in or mic) and
write to the default output stream (line out or spkr).  These defaults
can be set in the alsa configuration.

REMOTE CONTROL

Optionally, a small webserver can be used to control tmrd from a
laptop or smartphone.  The server must be run on the machine hosting
tmrd.  To start the webserver, run:

> python tmrd_server.py

from the server directory.  To access the server, browse to port 8000
of the machine on which it is running.  Close the webserver with
ctrl-c.
